## Nhost Dev

`nhost dev` starts your local development environment.

```bash
$ nhost dev

⠇ Nhost is starting...

# The first time dev is run takes a bit longer because the database is being created

✔ Local Nhost backend is running!
GraphQL API:	http://localhost:8080/v1/graphql
Hasura Console:	http://localhost:9695
Auth & Storage:	http://localhost:9000
API:			http://localhost:4000
```

> The local websocket url is `ws://localhost:8080/v1/graphql`

Great! You now have a Nhost backend locally with all services:

- PostgreSQL
- Hasura GraphQL Engine
- Hasura Backend Plus
- Custom API

The Hasura console (`http://localhost:9695`) was launched. Use this URL specifically to make changes in Hasura to track migrations and metadata automatically (recommended). All metadata and migrations are stored in the `nhost/` folder.

## Logs

Get local logs for each service when you develop locally.

### PostgreSQL

```bash
$ docker logs -f nhost_postgres
```

### Hasura GraphQL Engine

```bash
$ docker logs -f nhost_hasura
```

### Hasura Backend Plus

```bash
$ docker logs -f nhost_hbp
```

### Custom API

```bash
$ docker logs -f nhost_api
```

## Configuration

> Note that for the below configurations to take effect, you need to restart `nhost dev`.

### Permission variables

To add permission variables to the JWT token set `JWT_CUSTOM_FIELDS` in `.env.development`.

Example: if every user has a `company_id` column that should be used as a permission variable in the JWT token (`x-hasura-company-id`):

```bash:.env.development
JWT_CUSTOM_FIELDS=company_id
```

### Registration custom fields

To add registration custom fields set `REGISTRATION_CUSTOM_FIELDS` in `.env.development`

Example: If users should be able to set `display_name` on registration.

```bash:.env.development
REGISTRATION_CUSTOM_FIELDS=display_name
```

## Networking

The docker containers all expose their ports directly on the host machine, so you can both reach them on localhost as well as on the host machine IP address from another machine connected to the same network (if firewall rules allows).

### Expo

In Expo, to make development use the dev environment both in the simulator and in Expo Go and production use production, see code below:

```
export const URL =
  Constants.manifest.packagerOpts.dev && !Constants.isDevice
    ? "http://localhost:9001"
    : typeof manifest.packagerOpts === `object` && manifest.packagerOpts.dev
    ? `http://${manifest.debuggerHost.split(`:`).shift().concat(`:9001`)}`
    : "nhost.io cloud url";
```
